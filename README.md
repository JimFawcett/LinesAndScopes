# RustLinesAndScopes

simple code analysis - finds, in a dir tree, files matching patterns, and counts lines, scopes, and functions
in each file.  
- Built as a quick analysis tool
- Will eventually be replaced with a RustCodeAnalysis tool using a rule-based parser.
- There is a similar parser for C++ here: <a href="https://github.com/JimFawcett/CppParser">CppParser</a>
- And one for C# here: <a href="https://github.com/JimFawcett/CsParser">CsParser</a>
